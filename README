This project is the code collection for my diploma thesis on algorithmic recruitment. 
The idea is based on matt's blog post: http://www.hackdiary.com/2010/02/10/algorithmic-recruitment-with-github/

Please bear with me as I'm not an coding artist. This is just for proof of concept for my thesis ;-)
